Paper Aircraft Landing Gear
Introduction

Paper airplanes are simple flying models, but they provide an excellent platform to explore real engineering concepts such as aerodynamics, weight distribution, and landing dynamics. Most paper airplane designs focus only on glide performance, with little attention given to how the aircraft lands.

This project introduces a detachable, 3D-printable landing gear system along with a paper airplane designed for smooth and controlled landings, turning a basic paper model into a small experimental aircraft.

Project Description

This project explores a lightweight, clip-on landing gear for paper airplanes, designed to reduce impact forces and enable smoother landings without permanently modifying the aircraft.

The landing gear attaches securely to a paper airplane and provides rolling or sliding contact with the ground. Along with the gear, a paper airplane design optimized for stable descent and smooth touchdown was developed and tested as part of the system.

The goal of this project is to study how added mass, rolling friction, and gear placement affect flight behavior, landing smoothness, and overall stability in lightweight paper aircraft. The design emphasizes simplicity, reusability, and minimal material usage, making it suitable for experimentation and demonstrations.
